 * past the first session-only event and resubscribes in a tight loop (thousands

 *
 * Fixed: `HostConnection.ts` opens the host feed with `gapless: false` (the
 * dedupe by sequence is enough: a dropped subscriber's stream ends, it is never
 * skipped), and a feed's reopens that make no progress back off.

 *
 * Fixed: the session machine ignores an `ApprovalRequested` whose `turnId` is
