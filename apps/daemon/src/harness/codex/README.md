# Codex Harness driver

Implements `HarnessDriver` (`../HarnessDriver.ts`) for Codex by driving the user's own, unmodified `codex` binary through `codex app-server`. Linear: ENG-191; decisions in ENG-171 and ENG-175.

## Design

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `CodexDriver.ts` | `makeCodexDriver(options)`: the driver value. `probe` runs `codex --version` and nothing else. `capabilities = { steer: true, liveCoAttach: true }`. `HarnessRegistryLive` (`../registry.ts`) imports it, and with it the schemas in `protocol.ts`, on the first `probe` or `open`, in the registry's scope; an idle Daemon never loads it. |
| `AppServer.ts` | The one app-server per Host: `codex app-server --listen unix://<socket>`, started lazily on the first `open`, **detached** so it outlives the Daemon (see "App-server lifecycle" below). |
| `RpcConnection.ts` | JSON-RPC 2.0 over app-server's Unix-socket transport, which is **WebSocket over the socket** (HTTP Upgrade, one message per text frame). Bun's WebSocket client speaks it as `ws+unix://<path>`. |
| `CodexSession.ts` | One Agent Session = one connection + one Codex thread. Translates notifications and server→client requests into `HarnessEvent`s. |
| `mapping.ts` | Pure translations: permission modes, turn input, thread items → `TurnItem`s, approval decisions. |
| `models.ts` | `listModels`: `model/list` (every page, hidden Models left out) on the shared app-server when it's running, else on a private `codex app-server` over stdio that exits right after (`connectStdio` in `RpcConnection.ts`). |
| `protocol.ts` | Effect Schemas that validate the fields the driver reads, each checked at compile time against the generated type. |
| `generated/` | TypeScript bindings from `codex app-server generate-ts`, trimmed to the import closure of what the driver uses. Generated from **codex-cli 0.159.2** (`generated/version.ts`). |
| `planLimits.ts` | With `planLimits` set, each session sends `account/rateLimits/read` once it has connected and reports `account/rateLimits/updated` notifications, merged through one `CodexLimitTracker` per driver. See `../limits/README.md`. |
| `testing/FakeAppServer.ts` | A scriptable fake app-server on a real Unix socket (same WebSocket transport) and a replayer for recorded traffic. |

### Shared server and live co-attach

The Daemon owns one app-server per Host on `~/.polaris/codex.sock` (keep it short: Unix socket paths are capped near 104 bytes; app-server itself symlinks long paths, but other clients may not). Each `open` makes its own connection, sends `initialize`/`initialized`, then `thread/start` (fresh) or `thread/resume` with `excludeTurns: true` (`resumeCursor`). The thread id is the cursor (`CursorAssigned`). Closing the session's scope sends `thread/unsubscribe` and closes the connection; the app-server unloads the thread after its own 30-minute idle grace.

`terminalCommand` is `codex resume <threadId> --remote unix://<socket>`. The TUI attaches to the same server, and `thread/resume` on a loaded thread rejoins it, so Polaris and the TUI see the same live events and either can answer an approval. Polaris then gets `serverRequest/resolved` and emits `ApprovalWithdrawn`. Turns the TUI starts reach Polaris as notifications for an unknown Codex turn id. The driver mints a `TurnId` for them and emits `TurnStarted` when the Turn's `userMessage` item arrives, with its text as the `prompt` (app-server sends `turn/started`, then the user message). If anything else in the Turn comes first (Polaris rejoined a thread mid-Turn), `TurnStarted` goes out then, without a prompt. Turns Polaris starts carry the prompt it sent.

Verified on this Host (codex-cli 0.157.1): `--listen unix://PATH` serves WebSocket-over-Unix (a raw HTTP Upgrade returns `101`), and Bun's `ws+unix://` connects to it. `codex app-server proxy --sock` is a raw byte pipe, not a JSONL bridge, so it isn't used. The TUI's `--remote unix://` flag exists on both `codex` and `codex resume`. Live co-attach was exercised by hand with codex-cli 0.158.0 through the real Daemon (`apps/daemon/scripts/e2e-codex-tui.ts`, gated by `POLARIS_E2E_CODEX_TUI=1`; two tiny real Turns): a supervised session takes a Turn from Polaris, goes In Terminal, and `codex resume <thread> --remote unix://…/codex.sock` in a PTY shows that Turn's reply (same thread). A Turn typed in the TUI reaches Polaris as `TurnStarted` within ~0.1 s; its command approval shows in both the TUI ("Would you like to run the following command?") and Polaris (`ApprovalRequested`, kind `command`, on the minted Turn); answering it from Polaris runs the command, the TUI drops its prompt and shows the command as run, Polaris records exactly one `ApprovalRequested` and one `ApprovalResolved`, and the Turn ends `completed` in Polaris. `ReturnFromTerminal` brings the session back to Idle. At that run the TUI's Turn arrived with an empty prompt; `TurnStarted` now carries the TUI Turn's `userMessage` text (ENG-194).

### App-server lifecycle

The server must outlive the Daemon, or a Daemon restart, crash or upgrade would end the user's co-attached `codex --remote` TUI. So it is never the Daemon's child:

- **Start**: `/bin/sh -c '"$@" </dev/null >>log 2>&1 & echo $!'` spawned with `detached: true` (setsid). The shell prints the server's pid and exits, so the server is reparented to init, in its own session and process group, with stdio on `~/.polaris/logs/codex-app-server.log`. No Daemon pipe, process group or PID (which an execve upgrade keeps) ties it to the Daemon. launchd `bootout` of the Daemon's job leaves it running (verified on macOS). Under systemd (`INVOCATION_ID` set), stopping `polaris.service` kills its whole cgroup, so the server is started through `systemd-run --user --scope --collect` in its own scope.
- **Record**: `~/.polaris/codex-app-server.json` holds `{ pid, version, codexPath, socketPath, startedAt, sanitizedEnv }`. New servers set `sanitizedEnv: true`: the launcher explicitly excludes the Daemon's `POLARIS_HANDOFF`.
- **Adopt**: the next Daemon (after a restart, crash or execve upgrade) finds it answering on the socket and connects; Codex sessions resume by cursor as after any reconnect.
- **Replace**: before this Daemon has a connection of its own, it compares the recorded version with `codex --version`. If codex was upgraded and `thread/loaded/list` is empty (no Polaris session or TUI is live on it), the old server is stopped and a new one started; otherwise it is kept. A recorded server that is alive but not answering is replaced. Before any signal, the pid's command line must still name `app-server` and the socket (pids get reused).
- **Stop**: `polaris uninstall` calls `stopAppServer` (SIGTERM, SIGKILL after 5 s, then removes the state file and socket). Tests that spawn a real server must call it too.

Servers recorded before environment filtering have no `sanitizedEnv` marker. They may retain an old hand-off envelope even after the Daemon consumes its own copy. A later `open` replaces an idle legacy server, without requiring a Codex version change. Live or uninspectable servers are kept, with one environment-migration log per Daemon lifetime; the next idle `open` retries. Externally managed servers are never migrated. New Daemons validate inherited hand-off descriptors so a child of a retained legacy server still starts fresh safely.

Tests: `AppServer.test.ts` runs the real lifecycle against a fake `codex` executable (`testing/fakeCodex.ts`, which serves `FakeAppServer`): detached and not our child, adopted by a second "Daemon", replaced after a version change only when no thread is loaded, a dead server replaced, stop, and pid-reuse safety.

### Event mapping

| app-server | HarnessEvent |
|---|---|
| `thread/start`/`thread/resume` result | `CursorAssigned { cursor: thread.id }` |
| `turn/started` + `userMessage` item (or first sight of an unknown turn id) | `TurnStarted { prompt }` |
| `item/started` (commands, file changes, tool calls) | `ItemUpdated` (live progress, `running`) |
| `item/agentMessage/delta`, `item/plan/delta`, `item/reasoning/summaryTextDelta`, `item/reasoning/textDelta` | `ItemDelta { field: "text" }` |
| `item/commandExecution/outputDelta` | `ItemDelta { field: "output" }` |
| `item/completed` | `ItemCompleted`: agentMessage/plan → AssistantMessage, reasoning → Reasoning (summary, else raw content), commandExecution → CommandExecution, fileChange → FileChange (`update` → `modify`), mcpToolCall → ToolCall `server.tool`, dynamicToolCall/collabAgentToolCall/webSearch/imageView → ToolCall. A Turn's first user message (its prompt), compaction and review markers are skipped; later user messages are steers (`UserMessage`). |
| `turn/plan/updated` | `ItemUpdated` with the `Plan` (id `<codexTurn>:plan`, its `explanation` when not blank) each time; the latest plan is completed once, just before `TurnEnded` |
| `error` with `willRetry: false` | `ItemCompleted` with an `Error` item, its message made readable (below) |
| `turn/completed` | `TurnEnded { status, error }`, the error made readable (below) |
| `thread/name/updated` | `TitleSuggested` |
| `item/started` / `item/completed` for reasoning | a live `Reasoning` (`ItemUpdated`, empty text) timed from `startedAtMs`, completed with `endedAt` from `completedAtMs` (`reasoning.ts`; the driver's clock when a stamp is missing) |
| `thread/tokenUsage/updated` | `ContextUsed { usedTokens: last.totalTokens, windowTokens: modelContextWindow }` |
| `serverRequest/resolved` for a request Polaris didn't answer | `ApprovalWithdrawn` |
| connection closed by the server | `Exited { error }`; scope close gives `Exited { error: null }` |

Notifications for other threads on the shared server are ignored, except a Subagent's.

**Readable errors** (`readableError` in `mapping.ts`): Codex forwards the provider's error body as the message (`{"type":"error","error":{"message":…}}`, sometimes after a prefix such as `unexpected status 400:`), so the inner `error.message` is used. A rejected Model (`model '<id>' is not …`) becomes "<id> isn't available on this Codex account or plan. Choose another Model." followed by what Codex said. `model/list` has no per-account flag to filter such Models out beforehand (checked with codex-cli 0.158.0 on a "prolite" account: every listed Model has the same `hidden`, `upgrade`, `availabilityNux` and `availableAccessPrograms`).

### Subagents

A Codex agent spawned from the Polaris thread runs in a thread of its own on the same app-server, and its notifications reach the session's connection (verified with codex-cli 0.158.0). `subagents.ts` tracks them:

| parent-thread item | HarnessEvent |
|---|---|
| `subAgentActivity` `started` (multi-agent v2) | a `ToolCall` `agent.spawn` of the Turn (its id is the spawning call's), and `SubagentStarted { subagentId: agentThreadId, parentItemId: that item, title and agent: the agent's name (the last segment of `agentPath`) }`, so the card sits where it was spawned and the Turn's later messages come after it |
| `subAgentActivity` `completed` / `interrupted` | `SubagentEnded` |
| `collabAgentToolCall` `spawnAgent` (v1) | one `SubagentStarted` per `receiverThreadIds` entry (title: the prompt's first line, `model`) |
| `collabAgentToolCall` `agentsStates` | `SubagentEnded` for each agent `completed` / `errored` (→ failed) / `interrupted` / `shutdown` / `notFound` |

Items, deltas and progress on a Subagent's thread are its own (`subagentId` = its thread), under the Polaris Turn that spawned it. Its own Codex turns map to that Turn too, and its `turn/completed` ends nothing. A server request (approval, question) carries its thread: one from a Subagent's thread goes to the Turn that spawned it, or to the Turn in flight when the parent hasn't reported the spawn yet (codex-cli 0.159 asks before it does). It never starts a Polaris Turn: one did, and left two empty Turns stuck working after a Reviewer's real one (`subagentTurns.test.ts`). The collab call itself stays a `ToolCall` of the Turn. `subagents.test.ts` replays `fixtures/subagent-turn.jsonl`, a real Turn that spawned one agent (scrubbed).

### Approvals

| server request | ApprovalKind | `respond` sends |
|---|---|---|
| `item/commandExecution/requestApproval` | `command` | Allow → `accept` (`acceptForSession` if `remember`), Deny/Answer → `decline` |
| `item/fileChange/requestApproval` | `file-change` | same |
| `item/permissions/requestApproval` | `tool` | Allow → grants exactly the requested profile, scope `session` if `remember` else `turn`; Deny → `{}` |
| `item/tool/requestUserInput` | `question` | Answer → the text for every question; Allow → each question's first option; Deny → no answers |
| `mcpServer/elicitation/request` | `tool` | Allow → `accept` `{}`; Answer → `accept` `{answer}`; Deny → `decline` |
| anything else (`item/tool/call`, `account/chatgptAuthTokens/refresh`, `attestation/generate`, legacy v1 approvals) | — | JSON-RPC error `-32601`. Polaris never handles credentials. |

**Async questions** are agent messages with `delivery: "async"` and `questions`. They arrive as `item/completed` notifications, not requests, and can outlive their Turn. Each question becomes an `ApprovalRequested` of kind `question`. `respond` with `Answer` sends the text as a new user message: `turn/steer` if a Turn is in flight, otherwise `turn/start` of a new Turn, which gets a minted `TurnId` and a `TurnStarted`. Allow and Deny just close the question.

### Permission modes

| Polaris | `approvalPolicy` | `approvalsReviewer` | sandbox |
|---|---|---|---|
| supervised | `untrusted` | `user` | `read-only` |
| auto-edits | `on-request` | `user` | `workspace-write` |
| auto | `on-request` | `auto_review` | `workspace-write` |
| full-access | `never` | `user` | `danger-full-access` |

The table follows T3 Code's runtime modes. These values go on `thread/start`/`thread/resume` and on every `turn/start` (as `sandboxPolicy`); Codex persists turn overrides on the thread. `setPermissionMode` takes effect from the next `turn/start`.

### Models, effort and fast mode

- **Listing** (`models.ts`): `model/list`, `includeHidden: false`, following `nextCursor`. `Model.id` is the entry's `model` (what `turn/start` takes), `efforts` its `supportedReasoningEfforts`, `defaultEffort` its `defaultReasoningEffort`, `isDefault` as reported. Asking never starts a thread. When the shared server isn't running it is **not** started for a listing (it is detached and would outlive the Daemon): a private `codex app-server` on stdio answers and is killed with the request's scope. Cost measured with codex-cli 0.158.0: ~0.13 s to `initialize`, ~0.5 s for `model/list` (Codex fetches the catalogue for the signed-in account). The Daemon caches the answer per Host (`../HarnessRpcs.ts`).
- **Switching** (`switchModel: true`): each `turn/start` carries the Turn's `model` and `effort`. Codex applies overrides "for this turn and subsequent turns" of the thread, so a Model changed with `SetModel` takes effect at the next Turn without reopening. A null field is omitted, which keeps whatever the thread last ran with; Codex has no way to clear an effort override back to the Model's default, so a Client should send a concrete effort (the Model's `defaultEffort`) rather than null after choosing one. Answers to async questions reuse the last Turn's Model, effort and service tier.
- **Fast mode**: the Session and each Turn record `serviceTier`. `priority` enables fast routing; `default` explicitly disables it; an absent selection preserves the Harness default. Start and resume requests receive it too. The selector and `/fast` share the capability-gated Client settings path (`session.service-tier`, `SetModel`), without creating a Turn. Same-Harness Forks inherit the selection; another Harness clears it.

`OpenOptions.readOnly` overrides every permission mode: `never` approvals, `user` reviewer, and `read-only` sandbox (network off), on thread start/resume and each Turn. Codex Subagents inherit the thread's policy. Late server requests from any thread on the session connection are declined without emitting `ApprovalRequested`; changing the permission mode cannot widen the sandbox.

### Other commands

- `sendTurn`: `turn/start` with a text input, plus a `localImage` input (staged Host path) per image attachment. Other attachments are listed by path at the end of the prompt. Fails if a Turn is already in flight.
- `steer`: `turn/steer` with `expectedTurnId` set to the in-flight turn. Fails if none is in flight. Codex's answer records it as a `UserMessage` item; a Turn's later `userMessage` items (a steer from a co-attached TUI) do too, and `steers.ts` keeps one item when both report the same steer. The Turn's first user message is its prompt.
- `interrupt`: `turn/interrupt`, or nothing when idle. The Turn then ends `interrupted`, and open approvals come back as `ApprovalWithdrawn`.

### Skills and Slash Commands (`commands.ts`, `slash.ts`)

`listCommands(cwd)` asks `skills/list` with `cwds: [cwd]` over the same connection as `model/list` (the shared server if it runs, else a private stdio one that exits; ~0.7 s with codex-cli 0.159.2), reads custom prompts from `$CODEX_HOME/prompts/*.md`, and adds the built-ins Polaris can run:

| Command | How it runs |
|---|---|
| a Skill (`$name`) | `text`: the Turn's text carries `$name`, which Codex's Skill instructions resolve; disabled Skills are left out. Source from its scope (`user`, `repo` → project, `system`/`admin` → built-in) or `plugin` with a `pluginId` |
| `/prompts:<name>` (custom prompt) | `text`, with `template`: the file's body (after frontmatter), `$ARGUMENTS` standing for what follows. app-server doesn't expand prompts (only the TUI does), so the Client sends the body |
| `/compact` | `harness`: a Turn whose prompt is exactly `/compact` runs `thread/compact/start`; the compaction Turn's `turn/started` takes the pending Polaris Turn. Its only item, `contextCompaction`, isn't shown; the new context size arrives as `ContextUsed` |
| `/review [instructions]` | `harness`: `review/start`, inline, target `uncommittedChanges` or `custom` instructions; its reply's Turn is bound like `turn/start`'s. Codex then sends `turn/started` for a second turn id while items and `turn/completed` carry the first: that second id joins the review's Turn and never becomes the Turn in flight |
| `/fast` | `polaris` → `fast` |
| `/model` | `polaris` → `model` |
| `/new` | `polaris` → `new-session` |
| `/diff` | `polaris` → `diff` |
| every other TUI command (`/init`, `/status`, `/mcp`, `/approvals`, `/logout`, `/quit`…) | not offered |

Verified end to end with codex-cli 0.159.2 through the real Daemon (`POLARIS_E2E_CODEX_SLASH=1 bun --cwd apps/daemon scripts/e2e-codex-slash.ts [trace.jsonl]`, gpt-6-luna at low effort): "reply with ok" (~7 s), `/compact` (~1 s), `/review` of a one-line uncommitted change (~25 s, a command and the review as an `AssistantMessage`), then another Turn; each ends `completed`. `slash.test.ts` replays that traffic (`fixtures/slash-turns.jsonl`).

## Regenerating the bindings

```sh
bun apps/daemon/src/harness/codex/generate.ts            # uses `codex` on PATH
bun apps/daemon/src/harness/codex/generate.ts --codex /path/to/codex
bun run typecheck                                         # fails where protocol.ts drifted
```

It runs `codex app-server generate-ts` (stable surface, no `--experimental`) into a temp directory, copies the import closure of the roots listed in `generate.ts` unformatted (oxfmt ignores `generated/`), and rewrites `generated/version.ts`. To use a new message, add its type to `ROOTS` and a schema plus a `conforms<…>` line in `protocol.ts`.

## Tests

- `mapping.test.ts`: the pure rules.
- `CodexDriver.test.ts`: the driver against `FakeAppServer` on a real Unix socket. It covers a full Turn replayed from `fixtures/full-turn.jsonl` (recorded from a real codex 0.157.1 Turn, with paths and account notifications scrubbed), a command approval round-trip, interrupt with a withdrawn file-change approval, resume that rejoins a TUI-started Turn and steers it, a TUI-typed Turn with its prompt and live command and plan progress, an async question answered by a new Turn, refusal of a credential request, a dropped server, and a side-effect-free `probe`.
- `models.test.ts`: `model/list` paging and mapping against `FakeAppServer`, the stdio fallback against a stand-in `codex` script (and that its process is gone afterwards), and each Turn's `model`/`effort` on `turn/start`.
- `e2e.test.ts`: one real tiny Turn against the installed codex in a temp git repo. It uses your Codex sign-in and quota:

  ```sh
  POLARIS_E2E_CODEX=1 bun test apps/daemon/src/harness/codex/e2e.test.ts
  ```

  Set `POLARIS_CODEX_TRACE=/tmp/trace.jsonl` to record every JSON-RPC frame, for example to refresh the fixture.

## Known gaps / TODO

- **MCP form elicitations** accept with empty content; there's no UI for `requestedSchema` yet. An elicitation with no Turn mints a Turn that never ends.
- **Multi-question `requestUserInput`**: one Answer fills every question.
- Nothing restarts a server that dies between `open`s until the next `open`.
- An outdated server with a thread loaded is kept until a later `open` finds it idle; nothing checks again on a timer.
- The `systemd-run --user --scope` path is covered by an argv unit test only; it has not been run on a systemd Host.
- **PATH under launchd**: `Bun.which("codex")` may miss nvm/Homebrew installs when the Daemon runs as a user service. Pass `codexPath` or resolve it from a login shell.
