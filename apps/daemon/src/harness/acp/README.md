# ACP Harness driver

One `HarnessDriver` (`../HarnessDriver.ts`) for every curated Harness that speaks the [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com) (ACP v1, stable methods only), driving the user's own, unmodified binary as an ACP agent on stdio. Linear: ENG-208; decisions in ENG-199; research in `docs/research/multi-model-harnesses.md`.

Catalogue Harnesses on this driver: **Gemini CLI** (`gemini --acp`) and **GitHub Copilot CLI** (`copilot --acp`).

## Files

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `harnesses.ts` | Host-side data per Harness: binary, `POLARIS_<KIND>` override, ACP argv, config directory, scratch-home variable, TUI resume argv; and the permission mode → session mode ids. Plain data: the availability probe and the registry read it without loading the driver. |
| `AcpDriver.ts` | `makeAcpDriver`: the shared agent process (an `RcRef`), `probe`, `listModels`, `open`. Loaded by `../registry.ts` on first use (ENG-196). |
| `AgentConnection.ts` | Spawns the agent, speaks newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0, sends `initialize`, and routes `session/update` and `session/request_permission` to the session they name. |
| `AcpSession.ts` | One Agent Session = one ACP session: start/resume, Turns, approvals, interrupt, settings. |
| `translate.ts` | `session/update` → `HarnessEvent`s. |
| `permissions.ts` | Which requests Polaris answers itself by permission mode, how a request reads as an approval, which option a decision picks. |
| `models.ts` | Models and effort from session config options. |
| `protocol.ts` | Effect Schemas for the fields the driver reads, each checked at compile time against `@agentclientprotocol/sdk`'s types (a type-only dev dependency: nothing from it loads at runtime). |
| `testing/` | `fakeAgent.ts`, a scriptable ACP agent run as a real process, and test helpers. |

## Process model

One agent process per Harness per Host serves all of its Agent Sessions (ACP multiplexes sessions by id). It starts with the first `open` and stops when the last session's scope closes; the binary is looked up at each start, so a Harness installed after the Daemon started is found. If it crashes, every open session gets `Exited { error }` (with the last lines of its stderr) and the next `open` starts a new one.

`initialize` offers the agent no file system and no terminal (`fs` and `terminal` false): the Harness uses its own tools, and Polaris sees them as tool calls. Polaris never calls `authenticate` or `logout` (ADR 0001).

## Sessions

- **Start**: `session/new { cwd, mcpServers: [] }`. An agent that answers `-32000` (auth required) isn't signed in: `open` fails with "\<Harness\> isn't signed in on this host." plus the catalogue's sign-in line. The session id is the cursor (`CursorAssigned`).
- **Resume**: `session/resume` when the agent declares `sessionCapabilities.resume`, else `session/load` (declared by `loadSession`), whose history replay is dropped: the engine already has it. An agent that declares neither starts a new session, with a new cursor.
- **Close**: `session/close` when declared; the process stops with the last session.

## Turns

`sendTurn` sends `session/prompt` (text, then each attachment as a `resource_link` to its staged file) and returns once it is written; the response ends the Turn:

| `stopReason` | `TurnEnded` |
|---|---|
| `end_turn` | `completed` |
| `cancelled` | `interrupted` |
| `max_tokens`, `max_turn_requests`, `refusal` | `failed`, with why |
| JSON-RPC error | `failed`, with its message |

One Turn at a time; `steer` isn't in ACP v1, so it fails and the capability is off. `interrupt` sends `session/cancel` and answers the Turn's open permission requests `cancelled` (ACP requires it), withdrawing them (`ApprovalWithdrawn`).

## Event mapping

| `session/update` | HarnessEvent |
|---|---|
| `agent_message_chunk` | `ItemDelta` on an open `AssistantMessage` |
| `agent_thought_chunk` | `ItemDelta` on an open `Reasoning` |
| `tool_call`, `tool_call_update` (merged by id) | `ItemUpdated` while pending or in progress, `ItemCompleted` once completed or failed. `execute` → `CommandExecution` (command from `rawInput.command`, output from its text content, exit code from `rawOutput.exit_code`/`exitCode`); `edit`/`delete`/`move` with diffs or locations → `FileChange` (a diff without `oldText` is an add); anything else → `ToolCall` |
| `plan` | `ItemUpdated` with the `Plan` (`<turn>:plan`); completed once when the Turn ends |
| `session_info_update` with a title | `TitleSuggested` |
| `notice` with severity `error` | `ItemCompleted` with an `Error` item |
| `current_mode_update`, `config_option_update` | kept as session state |
| `user_message_chunk`, `available_commands_update`, `usage_update`, compaction | ignored |

ACP text chunks have no end marker, so a text item stays open until something else happens in the Turn (a tool call, the other kind of text, a new `messageId`) or the Turn ends, and is then completed once.

## Approvals

`session/request_permission` becomes Needs You unless the permission mode lets its tool kind through, in which case Polaris answers `allow_once` itself:

| Permission mode | Let through without asking |
|---|---|
| supervised | `read`, `search`, `think` |
| auto-edits | those, `edit`, `move` |
| auto | those, `execute`, `fetch` |
| full-access | everything |

The approval's kind is `command` for `execute`, `file-change` for `edit`/`delete`/`move`, else `tool`; its detail is the command, the paths, or the raw input. `respond`: Allow → `allow_once` (`allow_always` when `remember`), Deny → `reject_once`, Answer → the option whose name or id matches, else `cancelled`. A denied tool call is completed as `declined`.

The Harness's own policy still applies on its side: when a session offers modes (or a "mode" config option), the permission mode also selects the first matching id from `MODE_IDS` in `harnesses.ts` (for example `yolo` for full-access, `default` for supervised).

## Models and effort

Through session config options (ACP's current way; the unstable `session/set_model` is not used): the `select` option in the `model` category is the Model, the one in `thought_level` the effort. Before each Turn (and at open) the driver sends `session/set_config_option` for a Model or effort that differs from the session's and that the Harness offers; anything else is left as it is. `listModels` opens a throwaway session in `~/.polaris/acp/<kind>` (closed at once when the Harness declares `close`) and lists the Model choices. ACP gives effort choices for the current Model only, so every Model lists those.

## In Terminal

No co-attach (`liveCoAttach: false`): the engine closes the session and hands off. Copilot reopens it with `copilot --resume=<session id>`. Gemini CLI's `--resume` takes only `latest` or a list index, so it has no terminal command.

## Availability

`../availability/probe.ts` probes each Harness with `--version` only; ACP Harnesses have no sign-in status command. A Host without the Harness's config directory (`$GEMINI_CLI_HOME/.gemini` or `~/.gemini`; `$COPILOT_HOME` or `~/.copilot`) has never run it: `needs-sign-in`. Otherwise the status is `unknown` ("reports its sign-in when a session starts"), and an `open` that isn't signed in fails with the sign-in hint.

`minVersion`: Gemini CLI `0.33.0`, the first with `--acp` (earlier releases only have `--experimental-acp`). Copilot CLI `1.0.0`, its first general release (ACP, session load and effort config predate it).

Side effects, measured with Gemini CLI 0.61.0 and Copilot CLI 1.0.89 in an empty home: `gemini --version` writes `~/.gemini/projects.json` temp files, so it runs with `GEMINI_CLI_HOME` on an empty scratch directory that is removed afterwards and the home stays empty. `copilot --version` unpacks its own package cache into `~/Library/Caches/copilot` (the same on every start of that version); nothing else.

## Tests

- `AcpDriver.test.ts`: the driver against `testing/fakeAgent.ts` run as a real process. A full Turn (text, thoughts, a tool call, a plan, a title); approvals (Allow with remember, Deny marks declined, auto-allowed by mode); interrupt; one Turn at a time and no steer; not signed in; resume by `session/load` (replay dropped) and by `session/resume`; Model and effort via config options and `listModels`; permission mode → session mode; one shared process, a crash, and a new process after it; terminal handoff; close.
- `e2e.test.ts`: one real tiny Turn against an installed Harness (its own sign-in and quota):

  ```sh
  POLARIS_E2E_ACP=copilot bun test apps/daemon/src/harness/acp/e2e.test.ts
  POLARIS_E2E_ACP=gemini  bun test apps/daemon/src/harness/acp/e2e.test.ts
  # Another ACP agent under that driver, e.g. an adapter:
  POLARIS_E2E_ACP=copilot POLARIS_E2E_ACP_ARGV='["/path/to/codex-acp"]' bun test apps/daemon/src/harness/acp/e2e.test.ts
  ```

  `POLARIS_ACP_TRACE=<file>` appends every JSON-RPC frame.

## Gaps

- `usage_update` (context used and cost) and `PromptResponse.usage` are ignored: `HarnessEvent` has no Usage event yet.
- Sign-in is only known when a session starts; availability reports `unknown` for an installed Harness that has run before.
- Unstable ACP methods (`session/fork`, `session/set_model`, `providers/*`) aren't used, so Fork and Model choice on Harnesses without config options are unavailable.
- Elicitation (`session/elicitation`) isn't offered, so a Harness can't ask free-form questions; questions arrive only as permission options.
- Gemini CLI has no terminal handoff (see In Terminal).
