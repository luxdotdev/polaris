/**
 * Byte streams over a Client's connection to the Daemon (ENG-613, ADR 0093): Host-address
 * streams (`hostAddress.ts`) and Browser streams (`browser.ts`). Each direction is one
 * long-lived blob, as `terminal.attachBinary` and `attachments.stage` already use, so the
 * Wire's round-robin keeps RPC frames ahead of the bytes; a blob's final chunk is that
 * direction's end (a half-close). A stream ends with its connection: its blobs fail `closed`.
 *
 * Flow control is credit-based, because the Wire buffers an incoming blob without pausing
 * its sender. Each side names a `window` when the stream opens: the bytes it will buffer
 * unread. A sender keeps `sent - credited <= window` and waits otherwise; a receiver grants
 * `Credit { bytes }` as it consumes them. The Client grants with `byteStream.credit`; the
 * Daemon grants with a `Credit` item on the RPC stream that opened the byte stream.
