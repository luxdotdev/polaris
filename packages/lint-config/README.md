# @polaris/lint-config

The shared [oxlint](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter) configuration (`oxlint.json`), the shared [oxfmt](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/formatter) style (`oxfmt.json`), and the custom oxlint plugins under `plugins/`. Every workspace has a `.oxlintrc.json` that extends `oxlint.json`, and so does the repo root (for `scripts/` and anything outside a workspace).

`bun run lint` runs oxfmt's format check (`oxfmt --check`), then the lint ratchet (`tooling/lint/ratchet.ts`), which runs oxlint over the repo and compares the result with the committed baseline.

## Formatting

`oxfmt.json` is the house style, kept in step with sightline's: 2-space indent, semicolons, double quotes, `trailingComma: "es5"`, `package.json` key order left alone, imports not sorted (sightline doesn't sort them either). The one difference is `printWidth`: 100 rather than sightline's 80, because `max-lines` (750) was set against 100-column code and rewrapping at 80 pushes six files over it through formatting alone. The root `oxfmt.config.mts` spreads it and adds Polaris's ignore paths, because oxfmt resolves `ignorePatterns` against the config file's own directory; it's found automatically, so `bun run format`, `oxfmt <files>` and editors all use it. oxfmt applies the ignores to explicit file arguments too.

## The rules

All at `error`. Type-aware rules run through `oxlint-tsgolint`, which uses the TypeScript 7 native compiler.

- **Correctness**: oxlint's `correctness` category.
- **TypeScript safety**: `no-explicit-any`, `ban-ts-comment`, `no-non-null-asserted-optional-chain`, `no-unsafe-*`, `no-floating-promises`, `no-misused-promises`, `await-thenable`, `only-throw-error`, `no-unnecessary-type-assertion` and friends (see `oxlint.json`). The `no-unsafe-*` rules are off for plain `.js`/`.mjs` files, which have no types to check.
- **`max-lines`**: 750 per file, blank lines skipped, comments counted.
- **`sonarjs/cognitive-complexity`**: 15 per function.
- **`polaris/no-long-comment`**: at most two lines of prose per comment.
- **anti-slop**: every generic rule, the native companion `oxc/no-accumulating-spread`, and every Effect rule.

## The ratchet

Existing violations are recorded in `tooling/lint/baseline.json` as counts per file and rule. `bun run lint` fails when a file's count for a rule goes above its baseline, which covers a new violation in an old file, any violation in a new file, and any rule a file wasn't breaking before.

- `bun run lint` checks the whole repo. `bun tooling/lint/ratchet.ts <files…>` checks just those files; the git hooks use that.
- When you fix baselined violations, lint says so. `bun run lint:baseline` then lowers the counts (and drops fixed or deleted files). It never raises a count or adds an entry.
- Commit the lowered baseline with the fix. Merge conflicts in `baseline.json` resolve by taking the lower count, or by running `bun run lint:baseline` after the merge.
- Renaming or splitting a file drops its baseline entry, so the new file must be clean. That's deliberate: the split is the moment to fix it.
- `--rebaseline` rewrites the baseline from scratch, loosening it. It exists for adding a new rule (record what the rule finds today, then ratchet it down). Say so in the commit message; never use it to get a change past lint.

## Policy

- **No disable comments** for `max-lines` or `sonarjs/cognitive-complexity`. If a case is genuinely irreducible, raise the policy, don't add an escape hatch. For the other rules, an `oxlint-disable-next-line` needs a reason on the same line, and a reviewer should push back.
- Comments count toward `max-lines` on purpose: a file doesn't get to be bigger because it explains itself in prose.
- Split a long file along its seams (a folder whose `index.ts` is the module's interface), not by size. No `utils.ts` dumping grounds.

## `polaris/no-long-comment` (`plugins/polaris/index.mjs`)

Caps a comment at **two lines of prose**. Long rationale in a source comment drifts out of date and has nowhere to record that the decision changed; that belongs in an ADR under [`docs/adr/`](../../docs/adr/).

A "comment" is a block comment, or an unbroken run of `//` lines that each own their line: a run of ten `//` lines is **one** violation. These lines don't count toward the cap:

- blank lines inside the comment;
- reference lines: `See docs/…`, a bare URL, a ticket id like `ENG-123`;
- tooling directives: `eslint-disable`/`oxlint-disable`, `@ts-expect-error`, `prettier-ignore`/`oxfmt-ignore`, and the `SAFETY:` line that `anti-slop/require-safety-comment-for-type-assertion` asks for.

JSDoc (`/** … */`) documents an API surface and is exempt. Trailing comments (code before them on the line) are never grouped or reported. A hashbang is not a comment.

Fixing a violation: if the comment explains **why**, write an ADR and leave a pointer; if it explains **what**, make the code say it (rename, extract); if it warns about a **trap at this call site**, keep it, in two lines. `MAX_PROSE_LINES` is the knob; raising it is a decision about the codebase, not a workaround.

## `sonarjs/cognitive-complexity` (`plugins/sonarjs/index.mjs`)

A one-rule wrapper around [`eslint-plugin-sonarjs`](https://github.com/SonarSource/SonarJS) (LGPL-3.0-only, a dev dependency pinned exactly, never shipped in the Daemon or Desktop App). oxlint has no native cognitive-complexity rule, and its `complexity` rule is cyclomatic, which punishes flat switches and lets deep nesting through. Only `cognitive-complexity` is registered.

## anti-slop (`plugins/anti-slop/`)

A vendored copy of [dmmulroy/anti-slop](https://github.com/dmmulroy/anti-slop) (MIT); provenance and update steps are in `plugins/anti-slop/UPSTREAM.md`. It is meant to be owned, not consumed: edit it to fit us and re-diff against upstream when pulling changes. It is excluded from oxfmt and from lint so its bytes stay close to upstream.

The Effect rules, with the reason for each:

- `anti-slop-effect/no-manual-tagged-construction`: build tagged values with their Schema `.make`, class constructor or `Data.taggedEnum` constructor, so the value is checked and the tag can't be misspelled.
- `anti-slop-effect/no-manual-tag-comparison`: branch on tags with `Match.tag`/`Match.tags` (or `Predicate.isTagged`) rather than `x._tag === "…"` or a `switch`, so exhaustiveness is checked.
- `anti-slop-effect/prefer-effect-match`: a chained literal ternary over one value is a `Match` waiting to happen.
- `anti-slop-effect/no-manual-effect-error-tag`: handle tagged errors with `Effect.catchTag`/`catchTags` (or `catchReason`), not by inspecting `_tag` inside a broad catch handler.
- `anti-slop-effect/no-service-constructor-imports`: don't import a `make<Service>` constructor into runtime code (tests may); yield the service and let its Layer provide it. Only relative imports are checked.

The generic rules that matter most day to day:

- `require-safety-comment-for-type-assertion`: every non-`as const` assertion needs a `// SAFETY: …` line stating the invariant that makes it true.
- `no-unknown-parameters` / `no-unknown-returns`: parse at the boundary (Effect Schema) instead of passing `unknown` around.
- `no-runtime-typeof`: same idea; narrow with a schema at the I/O edge, not `typeof` in the middle of the program.
- `no-object-parameters`: a function (including an `Effect.fn`) takes an owner-provided, named input type parsed at its boundary, not an inline object type.
- `no-known-value-widening`: `const x: Record<string, T> = { … }` throws away the known keys; prefer inference or `satisfies`.
- `no-module-mocking`: no `vi.mock`/`jest.mock`-style module mocking; replace dependencies through a real seam (a Layer).
- `require-readable-spacing`: blank lines between statement groups. Autofixable with `oxlint --fix`; oxfmt keeps the blank lines it adds (it preserves one blank line between statements and never adds or removes them).

## Fixtures

`bun run test` (or `bun test` in this package) runs `plugins/fixtures.test.ts`, which lints each plugin's `test/fixtures/` with its `test/fixtures.oxlintrc.json`: the clean fixtures must be silent, `long-comment.ts` must report exactly four groups, and `complex.ts` exactly one function. To eyeball one by hand:

```sh
cd packages/lint-config/plugins/polaris/test && ../../../../../node_modules/.bin/oxlint -c fixtures.oxlintrc.json fixtures
```

## Bumping oxlint

oxlint's JS plugin API is ESLint-compatible but alpha and outside semver, so every plugin here can break on a minor bump.

1. `oxlint` (root) and `@oxlint/plugins` (this package) must be the **same exact version**; bump them together. `oxlint-tsgolint` (root) must support the TypeScript version in use (its major tracks TypeScript's, `7.0.x` for TypeScript 7.0).
2. Run `bun run test` here (the fixtures) and `bun run lint` at the root. A plugin that fails to load shows up as an oxlint error, not as silence, but check the violation counts didn't collapse to zero.
3. If a bump changes what a rule reports, the ratchet shows it: new findings fail lint (fix them or discuss), fewer findings mean `bun run lint:baseline`.
4. `eslint-plugin-sonarjs` is bumped deliberately, alongside oxlint, with the same checks.

The anti-slop plugin is TypeScript, loaded through Node's type stripping, so the oxlint JS host needs Node ≥ 22.18 on `PATH` (CI installs Node 24).
