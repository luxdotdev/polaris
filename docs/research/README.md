# Research

Source research behind the Polaris planning map ([ENG-167](https://linear.app/luxdev/issue/ENG-167)). Each file answers one research ticket and cites its primary sources. These are snapshots taken when each ticket closed; for what was decided, read the tickets.

Additional planning research: [Editor language tooling](editor-language-tooling.md)
records the 2026-10-02 interview's checkout facts, upstream catalog, and
implementation constraints for [M3.1](../specs/editor-language-tooling-m3.1.md).

The prototype and spike code is throwaway and stays on its own branches, not on `main`:
- `prototype/orchestrator-layout` ([ENG-177](https://linear.app/luxdev/issue/ENG-177))
- `prototype/spike-electron` and `prototype/spike-gpui` ([ENG-184](https://linear.app/luxdev/issue/ENG-184))
- `prototype/pierre-diffs-spike` ([ENG-218](https://linear.app/luxdev/issue/ENG-218))

The original `research/*` branches remain.
