# Tailscale is the only way in from the network

## Context

The G2 app runs in the Even app on a phone, often away from the Mac, and Even Hub expects HTTPS
origins listed exactly in the app's manifest. Extensions authenticate with bearer tokens. The
alternatives were a plain-HTTP listener on the LAN (even-terminal's default), public tunnels
(ngrok, bore), or Tailscale.

## Decision

The gateway listens only on `127.0.0.1`. Remote Access runs
`tailscale serve --bg --https=443 --set-path /polaris http://127.0.0.1:<port>/polaris` (serve
strips the prefix, so the target names it again), which gives a
`https://<machine>.<tailnet>.ts.net/polaris` origin with an automatic certificate. The tailscale
module is adapted from T3 Code; it also finds the macOS app's bundled CLI.

## Consequences

- Tokens never cross a network in the clear, and nothing listens on the LAN.
- Remote Access needs Tailscale with HTTPS enabled for the tailnet; without it, only local
  Extensions work.
- `--set-path` shares port 443 with other HTTPS Serve paths (such as T3 Code), but enabling
  Serve clears Funnel for the entire listener. Polaris refuses enable with `funnel-on` when
  Funnel is on for this Host's port 443; it leaves the config alone and publishes no pairing
  URL. Turning off still removes only `/polaris` and its trailing-slash form, preserving
  other paths and their Funnel setting.
- A foreground Serve or background HTTP listener on port 443 blocks enable and disable with
  `port-in-use`; neither is rewritten or removed. Status is unavailable with this reason
  unless our proven gateway is already served at `/polaris`, in which case it stays on with
  its URL (Funnel still suppresses the URL).
- A file, text or trailing-slash handler at `/polaris` also counts as exposed. Unreadable
  Serve config is unavailable, never off.
- Remote Access serves only a gateway that answers a fresh challenge with the HMAC of
  `gateway.json`'s secret, and status reads what Tailscale actually serves, so a stale or foreign
  `/polaris` shows as exposed rather than off (ENG-400).
- Machine names appear in Certificate Transparency logs, as with any Tailscale HTTPS.
- Remote Access proxies to a port, so it checks the port is this Daemon's before serving it:
  the gateway writes a fresh private secret to `~/.polaris/gateway.json` at every start and
  proves it on `POST /polaris/identity` by HMAC-SHA256 over a fresh challenge. Both secret
  and challenge are decoded 32-byte base64url values; only the MAC is returned. A public
  nonce could be fetched and replayed by an impostor after the gateway stopped.
  See `apps/daemon/src/gateway/README.md` for limits and the verification contract.

Gateway proof requests refuse redirects: the recorded port itself must answer the challenge.
